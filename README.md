## Emoji Grid

This is a silly little webtoy that lets you specify what emoji will show up in a grid given their angle and distance from the cursor. You could make a bunch of clocks point their hour hands at the cursor, have smileys turn progressively more unhappy the closer your mouse gets, or whatever else your heart desires. A few presets are available under the grid itself, as well as a button to switch to defining your own settings. This works by placing emoji on a sort of polar graph where the center is the cursor.

Loosely inspired by DAN-BALL's [Compasses](https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/compass/).
